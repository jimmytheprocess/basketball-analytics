Examining the Presence of Home Court Advantage in NBA Basketball Teams 

Collaborator: Gao, Jimmy; Liebmann, Jason

Project Goal: To test the presence of home court advantage in NBA teams with hypothesis testing

Abstract: Professional basketball has been a fun game to watch among all professional sports. Out of the three major sports leagues NFL, NHL and NBA, NBA seems to have a huge, if not the most, impact of home court advantage on individual performance. Teams with better regular-season records will head into a 7-game playeroff series and benefit from this home court advantage as they start with two games at home and play more home than away games. The following project uses the 2016~2017 NBA Regular Season box score data to examine if there is home court advantage in NBA teams with 3 different hypothesis tests. Through using vivid data visualization and statistical techniques such as bootstrapping, we found that NBA teams do possess a home court advantage.
